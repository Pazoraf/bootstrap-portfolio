# Alexander Flaherty Bootstrap Portfolio


## Description
My intention with this project was to create a responsive website portfolio using the bootstrap CSS framework. To do this I wanted to minimise the use of CSS and media queries, and instead use the framework that bootstrap provides.

The site is deployed [here.](https://pazoraf.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/)
